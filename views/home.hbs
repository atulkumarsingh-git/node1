        <p>Node is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's
<a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">Event Machine</a> or Python's <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>. Node takes the event model a bit
further. It presents an <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/">event loop</a> as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems there is always a blocking call to start the
event-loop.
Typically behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script
and at the end starts a server through a blocking call like
<code>EventMachine::run()</code>. In Node there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node
simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node exits the
event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like
browser JavaScript â€” the event loop is hidden from the user.</p>
<p>HTTP is a first class citizen in Node, designed with streaming and low latency
in mind. This makes Node well suited for the foundation of a web library or
framework.</p>
<p>Just because Node is designed without threads, doesn't mean you cannot take
advantage of multiple cores in your environment. Child processes can be spawned
by using our <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options"><code>child_process.fork()</code></a> API, and are designed to be easy to
communicate with. Built upon that same interface is the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html"><code>cluster</code></a> module,
which allows you to share sockets between processes to enable load balancing
over your cores.</p>
